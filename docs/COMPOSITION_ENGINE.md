# Composition engine design

## Shared generator contract

Every generator receives a validated frozen context, target component, current/locked components and hashes, engine/generator/profile/schema versions, bounded parameters, and explicit seed. It returns canonical events, decisions/provenance, warnings, result hash, and structured errors. No ambient time, global random source, network, AI, database, locale, or unordered iteration may affect output.

Targeted regeneration loads authoritative harmony and locked components. The aggregate validator rejects changes whose hashes differ from submitted locks.

## Harmony engine

Inputs: key/scale, profile/section, tension, complexity, movement, voicing width/range, seed. Responsibilities: select a profile-approved functional/degree template; construct chords; choose inversions/voicings; optimize voice-leading under hard constraints and deterministic tie breaks. Return a structured unsatisfiable result rather than silently violating hard constraints.

## Bass engine

Stage 6 V1 receives a validated Harmony progression, uses each slot's Chord root, and selects the first legal root pitch nearest MIDI `43`, then each later slot pitch nearest the prior resolved Bass pitch, choosing the lower pitch on ties within the approved `36..60` range. The bounded straight-rhythm implementation projects that one slot pitch as `sustained`, straight quarter/eighth/sixteenth pulses, or the exact contracted offbeat-eighth pattern using integer slot-local timing. Omitted rhythm preserves the sustained one-event-per-slot baseline. The current Bass runtime has no seed input and reads no ambient randomness; seed lineage remains owned by the future enclosing generator boundary. Passing, approach, pedal, slash/inversion, compound or generalized syncopation/rest, cross-slot-tie, and profile-specific behavior are not active. The six named archetypes—Driving 8ths, Driving 16ths, Midtempo Stomp, Pedal Tone, Octave Pulse, and Syncopated Darkwave—and their eventual parameters remain separately authorized future slices; they must not be inferred from this contract.

## Arpeggiator

Stage 7A defines a documentation-only deterministic foundation over a validated Harmony progression. Its future parameter boundary is exactly rate (`quarter|eighth|sixteenth`), direction (`up|down|up-down|down-up`), inclusive absolute MIDI range, and integer `gateTicks`. It uses only the exact selected Harmony voicing pitches, filters rather than revoices them, projects monophonic immutable `ArpEvent` values, and resets traversal for every Harmony slot. See [Arpeggiator model](ARPEGGIATOR_MODEL.md) for normative cycles, validation, and boundary behavior.

Octave expansion, density/rest masks, seeded choice, `alternate` or `seededRandom` semantics, profile pattern selection, scale-tone transforms, and concrete profile musical policy remain future Stage 7 targets rather than accepted foundation enum values. They require separately reviewed contracts and evidence; the generic foundation alone cannot complete Stage 7 or AC-011.

## Melody/motif engine

Represent motif identity as a base interval/rhythm contour plus transformations. Build phrases using repetition, transposition, rhythmic displacement/augmentation where supported, call/response, chord targets, passing/tension notes, resolution, register/range, and leap/recovery constraints. Candidate scoring and tie breaking are deterministic and explainable; no arbitrary LLM note stream.

## Reproducibility and lineage

Specify and version the PRNG/seed encoding, parameter normalization, generator ordering, candidate sorting, and canonical serializer. A variation creates a child run/revision. Manual edits create a new revision with command provenance. History is not overwritten.

## Explanation records

Generators emit machine-readable decision codes and references (for example, selected template, voice-leading cost, archetype, target-tone position). AI or deterministic text may explain those records but cannot rewrite them.
